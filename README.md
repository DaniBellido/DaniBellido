<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, Welcome to Daniel's Portfolio</h1>

<h3 align="center"> 🔭 I am Daniel Bellido, a passionate Game Developer from Spain based in the UK</h3>


I’m currently studying Games Programming at Kingston University. **Computer Games Programming BSc (Hons)** 

As a second year student, I am looking for the opportunity to start in the industry working for a company (internship year) in order to expand my knowledge and be able to bring the best of myself to the business.

I am a curious and ambitious person, very passionate about learning and I am always looking forward to developing my skills. I am interested in Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence in videogames, modeling and animation, and I am an enthusiast of the C++ programming language.


<h3 align="center"> My Goals 🦾</h3>

My next goals are to further develop my skills as a Graphics Computer programmer in OpenGL and get started with other APIs like Vulkan and DirectX. Enhance my knowledge of CGI through modeling and animation with Maya and Blender. Continue creating projects with engines like Unity and Unreal 5, and also to investigate old development kits that I have recently acquired, such as the NETYAROZE. As a personal challenge, I want to develop my own basic graphics engine.

<h3 align="center"> ⭐️ CGI Project in Autodesk Maya </h3>

During my second year at the university, I received an introductory course in CGI where I have been able to develop new skills working with different tools such as Autodesk Maya, Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere. During the course, I have been able to create different scenes in which my final project stands out, which consisted of recreating a scene related to Star Wars.
In this work, a solid understanding of modeling with good topology, materials, advanced textures, UV layouts, and lighting is demonstrated. All rendered with Arnold and providing quality final images. Grade 85/100.
