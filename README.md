<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, Welcome to Daniel's Portfolio</h1>

<h3 align="center"> 🔭 I am Daniel Bellido, a passionate Game Developer from Spain based in the UK</h3>


I’m currently studying Games Programming at Kingston University. **Computer Games Programming BSc (Hons)** 

As a second year student, I am looking for the opportunity to start in the industry working for a company (internship year) in order to expand my knowledge and be able to bring the best of myself to the business.

I am a curious person and very passionate about learning and I am always looking forward to developing my skills. I am interested in Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence in videogames, modeling and animation, and I am an enthusiast of the C++ programming language.
